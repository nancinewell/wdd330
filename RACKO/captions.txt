Click "Play!"

Type in your name and hit the "Enter" key.

You and the computer will both be randomly dealt a hand of 10 cards.

Click the Draw Pile to draw a card.

Drag the card to the location you would like to place the card in your hand. The card already there will be discarded.

If you want the card in the Discard Pile, you can drag that card to your hand instead of drawing a card.

Once your turn is over, Johnny Five will take a turn.

If a player discards a card with a prime number (indicated with green), that player gets another turn.

Once the cards in your hand are in order from lowest to highest, you win! Your name will be recorded on the Winner Board.
